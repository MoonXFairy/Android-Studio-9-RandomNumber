# Android-Studio-9-RandomNumber
 This is a game of guessing numbers. Guess the number on page A and tell you if you guessed it on page B, and there is a guess prompt. However, the project will always change the guessed number, and there is no way to fix the number of questions. Generally speaking, it is not good enough.
